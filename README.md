# MLP-classifier-on-image-dataset
Overview

This project focuses on classifying images using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. The model is trained on an image dataset to recognize different classes efficiently.

Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple image categories stored in labeled directories. The images are preprocessed before feeding them into the neural network.

Technologies Used

>Python

>Scikit-learn

>TensorFlow/Keras (if using deep learning)

>OpenCV (for image processing)

>NumPy

>Pandas

Preprocessing

>Images are resized to a fixed dimension.

>Grayscale conversion (if required).

>Normalization of pixel values.

>Flattening images into feature vectors.

>Model Architecture

Input Layer: Flattened image features.

Hidden Layers: Fully connected dense layers with activation functions.

Output Layer: Softmax activation for classification.

Training

>The model is trained using the Adam optimizer.

>Categorical Crossentropy loss function is used for multi-class classification.

>Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Evaluation

>The trained model is tested on a separate dataset.

>Confusion matrix and classification report are generated for insights.

>Visualizations of training loss and accuracy trends.

>Matplotlib (for visualization)

Results

>Accuracy achieved on test data.

>Misclassified images analysis.

>Suggestions for improvements.

Future Improvements

>Experimenting with deeper architectures.

>Implementing data augmentation techniques.

>Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
